edited_pathline_trace_export_all_vars.py

pvbatch file tested on ParaView 5.9.1
- reads an input netCDF generated by merge_netcdfs/combine_grid_data.R
- constructs a pipline to generate pathlines
- exports the pathline geometry and data

- BUG: the generated .pvd will contain munged timesteps written in scientific notation with loss of precision

This is a ParaView state file which can be loaded in the GUI using
File | Load State. It shows the pipeline that can export pathlines 
using File | Save Data. This will export all visible
geometry, so make sure anything you don't want is invisible!
